              The existing phishing feature had become outdated and ineffective,
              with users finding the flow difficult to understand and the
              simulation limited in effectiveness. Key organisations were due to
              renew, and their decisions were heavily influenced by the design
              of this feature.

                The first key step was to reach out to key stakeholders in the
                business to understand more of why these processes had fallen
                behind, what problems were being reported and what areas needed
                to be addressed etc. This was to establish a baseline of the
                organisation's understanding and also establish next steps.

                experiences firsthand, gaining insight into their perspectives
                and needs.

                    At this point, our squad had limited knowledge about
                    phishing, as we were newly formed. The phishing feature had
                    been part of the platform for over three years without any
                    updates. During its initial development, the company lacked
                    the resources to further improve it. Consequently, user
                    needs had changed over time, and the codebase required
                    restructuring.

                    to speak to users to understand how they used phishing and
                    to validate the problems that had been flagged from customer

                helping us better grasp the challenges we faced and the
                potential opportunities ahead. We realised that while user
                interviews had pinpointed some issues, observing users during
                actual campaigns was crucial to gain deeper insights and address
                underlying concerns effectively.

                    Mapping out the flows based on what currently exsisted and
                    what we could then add helped to clarify to stakeholders
                    what we were aiming to achieve and to visualise the work so
                    everyone was onboard with the general scope of work and the
                    solutions we had prioritised.

                    Having defined the problem areas and user pain points, I
                    moved on to wireframing. I started with pencil sketches and
                    then used Whimsical to create rough flows. I developed a
                    range of flows and presented them to the squad. We
                    collaboratively evaluated and refined the designs, ensuring
                    they were feasible and user-centered.
                    
                    From this point I then reached out to the users we had initially
                    interviewed to get their thoughts and to help further refine
                    the design so that is targetted key pain points.

                We overhauled the flow and produced a simple step process in

                and putting them into separate flows as well as offering more
                context on what each does - this was also supplemented by
                introducing supplementary pages.

                  instantaneously and would start at the beginning of the week.
