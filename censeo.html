                        <p class="title_h6">Censeo is a digital triage process that aims to help GP’s by referring
                            patients suffering mental health issues to use their online assessment. Increasingly a large
                            number of patients have been referred but often find the process difficult to use as the
                            current site is not fit for purpose. This situation causes frustration for patients and
                            ultimately means that they are not completing the triage process which costs the GP’s money
                            and results in patients looping back and forth in the NHS system.</p>
