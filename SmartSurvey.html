                        creation process, making it both fast and effortless. Users can now upload pre-defined surveys,
                        and our platform takes over the creation process. This update not only saves valuable time but
                        also reduces user frustration, significantly enhancing overall satisfaction and retention.

                        led to frustration and reduced user retention, as users sought more streamlined solutions
                        elsewhere. Our goal was to address these issues and improve user engagement with our platform.

                            but still had to manually build each question, so I asked them about this issue.

                            <li>"You know, creating surveys can be quite a process. First, I have to draft
                                the questions and get them approved by different departments to ensure they align with
                                our standards and goals so often we already have a word doc to begin with that is
                                pre-determined”.</li>

                            <li>”I think thats were a lot of my time goes because once it’s built all you have to do
                                is distribute it which is easy”</li>

                            <li>”I find Creating surveys involves a lot of back-and-forth. Our questions are usually
                                reviewed by various departments for approval, and then build it using SmartSurvey . It’s
                                a bit of a hassle. If there was a way to upload a document or something then perhaps
                                that would be easier - I think Qualtrics used to let me do that.”</li>

                            <li>"Deciding on the right question types can be tricky for us. We receive templates for
                                surveys to create, but sometimes we're uncertain about which questions will work best."

                            <li>Enable the AI to recommend the most suitable question types (e.g., multiple-choice,
                                open-ended) based on the content of the pasted text.</li>
                            <li>Include a feature that allows users to regenerate or modify questions if the initial
                                AI-generated output is incorrect or suboptimal.</li>

                        <h6 class="title_h6_spc">In order to create an MVP we decided to add onto the current AI flow
                            for prompts as this meant it was easier for users to discover, would not interrupt squad
                            work
                            and meant we could tap into a steady stream of users already using the product.

                            Having discussed requirements, how we could utilise it in the current platform and
                            establishing the rough flow meant I could start with the initial designs.

                            From this point I then reached out to previous users to get their initial thoughts and
                            responses on our proposed solution and was met with overall positive responses altohugh it
                            did give us more to consider which helped mitigate later issues.

                                <li>"The import feature looks like it would be really efficient. Being able to paste
                                    questions and see them instantly in the survey preview seems like a huge
                                    time-saver."</li>
                                <li>"The design looks straightforward, but I wonder how well the AI handles more complex
                                    questions. If it struggles, users might need to spend extra time adjusting things

                                <li>"The design seems straightforward to me, and the tips provided on the side add some
                                    support. They seem like they could be useful and I like having pointers on how to
                                    get the most out of my questions"</li>
                                <li>"It’s great that the AI can format the questions, but I’d be concerned about it
                                    changing the intent. Maybe an option to preserve the original question type would be
                                    useful."</li>

                                    positive user feedback and a demo of the AI. We expanded the question types to 15
                                    and planned more updates. We then released a BETA version to feedback providers for

                                We implemented a beta rollout plan, using feature flags to release the new feature to
                                25% of both business and enterprise users. This allowed us to collect targeted feedback
